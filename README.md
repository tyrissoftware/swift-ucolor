# UColor 🍭

## Motivation

UColor stands for Universal Color. This library was built with the purpose of defining a model that would allow for easy 
color management. A UColor can be serialized, compared, and modified in a platform independent way. At usage time, we can transform it to a SwiftUI.Color, a UIColor or a NSColor. 

## Installation

Use it with swift package manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.org/tyrissoftware/swift-ucolor.git", from: "0.1.2")
```

## Documentation

Documentation for releases and main features of the library are available in the
"Documentation" folder".

- [**Usage**](Documentation/Hex.md): Hexadecimal utilities.

Check the tests to see how to construct UFonts, and what you can do with it.
